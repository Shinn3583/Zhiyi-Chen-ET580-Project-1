ET580 – Project I: Group A Summary Report

Phase 1
In Phase 1, our team implemented file reading and dynamic array storage. 
The program successfully reads numerical data from data.csv using the File class and stores it inside the StringArray container.
The output displays the loaded data correctly. Constructors, destructors, and encapsulation were applied to manage dynamic memory safely.

Phase 2
Phase 2 extended the project by adding sorting and searching functionalities according to Group A’s requirements.
We implemented and tested:
selectionSortAsc() for ascending order sorting,
linearSearch() for sequential search, and
binarySearch() for efficient lookup after sorting.
All methods performed correctly, producing accurate results and clean formatted output.

Team Contributions
Zhiyi Chen – Phase 1 initialization, dynamic memory setup, constructor/destructor.
Gabriel Sencion – File input handling, debugging CSV reading, and Makefile setup.
Giankarlo Gomez – Phase 2 implementation (sorting and searching), code formatting, and Makefile update.
Result
Both phases compile and run successfully with make. 
The output matches the project specifications.
